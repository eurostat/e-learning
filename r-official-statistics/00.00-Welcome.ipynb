    "R is the language created for data science.\n",
    "It will present the current state of the art libraries, and the trends for future developments in the ecosystem.\n",

R users benefit from the many resources and packages created by the community, while commercial companies (including Microsoft) provide tools to extend and support R, and services to help people use R.  \n",

    "3. Data Input: It's all about loading a database in the R environment; first part is about generic files: txt, csv, json, etc., or connectors for some database systems; second part is about specific packages created to be used for loading of official statistics databases.  \n",
    "4. Performance computing: this chapter is about processing the data with special enphasis on package data.table, and also an official statistics package, JDemetra.  \n",
    "5. Visualization with R: this chapter is also split in two; first part about basics already implemented in the default packages; followed by the evolutions, in the second part, with packages: ggplot2, Plotly and Shiny.  \n",
    "6. Machine Learning with R (bonus): Is just a small appetizer for what you can do in R about Machine Learning but without going to Deep Learning.  \n",
    "7. Real World Use Cases (bonus): Presenting some work done in official statistics environment with the help of R."
