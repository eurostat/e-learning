    "- R is an open-source software environment.\n",
    "- R can produce static graphics with production quality visualizations and has extended libraries providing interactive graphic capabilities.\n",
    "- Highly Active Community: The R environment is continuously growing. This growth is due to its large user-base.  \n",
    "- R contains a sea of packages for all the forms of disciplines like astronomy, biology, etc. While R was originally used for academic purposes, it is now being used in industries as well.\n",
    "- R has a very comprehensive development environment meaning it helps in statistical computing as well as software development.\n",
    "- R can be used to perform simple and complex mathematical and statistical calculations on data objects of a wide variety.\n",
    "- Distributed Computing: R has packages like ddR and multiDplyr that enable it to use distributed computing to process large data sets.\n",
    "- R is an interpreted language.\n",
    "- Interfacing with Databases: R contains several packages that enable it to interact with databases like Roracle, Open Database Connectivity Protocol, RmySQL, etc.\n",
    "- Data Variety: R can handle a variety of structured and unstructured data. It also provides various data modeling and data operation facilities due to its interaction with databases.\n",
    "- R can be used for machine learning as well. The best use of R when it comes to machine learning is in case of exploration or when building one-off models.\n",
    "- R with its extensive library of tools can be used for database manipulation and wrangling.\n",
    "- R is machine-independent. It supports the cross-platform operation.\n",
    "- While most of its functions are written in R itself, C, C++ or FORTRAN can be used for computationally heavy tasks.\n",
    "- R uses vectors and vector arithmetic and does not need a lot of looping to process a large set of values. This makes R much more efficient."
