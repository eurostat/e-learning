    "It will present the current state of the art libraries, and the trends for future developments in the ecosystem.\n",

    "Python has become over the last decades a first-class tool for scientific computing tasks, including the analysis and visualization of large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "This may have come as a surprise to early proponents of the Python language: the language itself was not specifically designed with data analysis or scientific computing in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usefulness of Python for data science stems primarily from the large and active ecosystem of third-party packages: `NumPy` (2005) for manipulation of homogeneous array-based data, `Pandas` (2008) for manipulation of heterogeneous and labeled data, `SciPy` (2001) for common scientific computing tasks, `Matplotlib` (2002) for publication-quality visualizations, `IPython` (2001), and later `Jupyter` (2014), for interactive execution and sharing of code, `Scikit-Learn` (2010) for machine learning, and many more tools that will be mentioned in the following pages.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [PyData](https://pydata.org/) world is certainly much larger than these packages, and is growing every day.\n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=''><img style='background: rgb(128, 128, 128, .15); align: left; display: inline-block; padding: 20px' src='img/jake-pydata-eco-pycon-2017.png'/></span>\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python ecosystem is evolving rapidly. We tried to give you a tool, this course, to help you understand this fast changing/growing system, the Python ecosystem and how to use it efficient for data science.\n",
    "Nevertheless, these packages are currently fundamental to much of the work being done in the Python data science space, and we expect they will remain important even as the ecosystem continues growing around them.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope to succeed in answering some of the whys of using Python for Data science and make the jurney also an efficient and entertaining one.\n"
