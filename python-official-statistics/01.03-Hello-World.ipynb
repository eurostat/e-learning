    "New notions pop-up in this example. Let's tackle them down, one by one:\n",
    "- First line is importing (loading in the Python context) a new module, `random`. A [module](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) contains some classes and functions you can use in your programs. SEveral modules can be grouped in a package. This particular one, as the name implies, deals with (pseudo)[random](https://docs.python.org/3/library/random.html) stuff.\n",
    "- Second line is creating, and assigning, a new variable called `adjs` with a new data type, a list (we will go later in details about lists).\n",
    "- Third line is adding the interactivity: function `input` will prompt in the console the text 'Your name: ' and will wait for the user to enter some character and will wait until Enter is pressed. Then will assign the result to the variable `name`.\n",
    "- Fourth line is creating another variable `adj`, which will contain one of the values of list adjs peeked randomly. You can see a function `choice` from package `random` used, and how the objectual way of selecting a function from a package (via dot) is used.\n",
    "- And finally in the last line we use the same print function with some [fancy formating](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/inputoutput.html) to print out the result.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can run the script (after copying the code into the file `interactive.py`) like this: `python interactive.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameterisable scripts\n",
    "Now you want to run these scripts automatically, without your intervention, but still need to give some extra information to the scripts, at runtime.  \n",
    "Here a very uninspiring script:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import sys\n",
    "if len(sys.argv) != 3:\n",
    "    print('The script must be provided with 2 parameters!')\n",
    "    exit(1)\n",
    "path, x, y = sys.argv\n",
    "print(f'path: {path}, x: {x}, y: {y}')\n",
    "```\n",
    "We introduce some new notions here:\n",
    "- The module imported in the first line, [sys](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html) is used to provide informations related to python interpreter.\n",
    "- Second line is adding more: You'll see how an if structure is constructed: if \\<boolean \\> and colon (:)\n",
    "- Next two lines is the if block, which is executed just if the if condition is true. A [block of code in Python](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/executionmodel.html) is defined by indentation.  \n",
    "In our example, if entity sys.argv do not contains exactly 3 elements, an error mesage will be shown and the script is ending the execution.\n",
    "- The fifth line is doing an unpacking, something very Python specific. Suffice for now to know that in this line the three variables: path, x and y will have the values for the script name and path as was sent to the Python interpreter, and the two parameters we type respectively when we run the script.\n",
    "\n",
    "As example you can run the script (after copying the code into the file `parameters.py`) like this: `python parameters.py first second`  \n",
    "And the result will be:\n",
