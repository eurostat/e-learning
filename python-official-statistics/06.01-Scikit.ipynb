    "### Large amount of training data\n",
    "For majority of ``old ML models`` after some amount the training data the performance will ``plateau``, but for ``DL models`` is keep ``geting better`` the more data is added.\n",
    "### Large models\n",
    "With neural networks, in general, the more layers and ``neurons`` you add the more performance you can obtain. This is why for DL the so called ``hierarchical feature learning`` when DL models automatically do feature extraction from row data, so the model become more important than understanding the data, learning without depending completely on human-crafted features.  \n",
    "### More computation\n",
    "As a result of both large training data and large models, the duration of training increase and the training price for such a model become quite expensive.\n",
    "Sometimes it is reffered as ``scalability of neural networks`` indicating that results get better with more data and larger models, that in turn require more computation to train.\n",
    "### GPT-3: The Largest Neural Network Ever Created\n",
    "As an example of achieved magnitudes in DL models let's explore GPT-3. OpenAI's GPT-3 architecture represents a seminal shift in AI research and use. The largest neural network ever developed promises significant improvements in ``natural language`` tools and applications.\n",
    "- 96 layers and 175 billion parameters: Parameters in machine language parlance depict skills or knowledge of the model, so the higher the number of parameters, the more skillful the model is. (100x bigger than GPT-2)\n",
    "- 45 terabytes of data: Training data from CommonCrawl, WebText, Wikipedia, and a corpus of books.\n",
    "- Cost and time: Since this information is not public, according to some estimate, training the 175-billion-parameter neural network requires 3.114E23 FLOPS (floating-point operation), which would theoretically take 355 years on a V100 GPU server with 28 TFLOPS capacity and would cost 4.6 million at $1.5 per hour.\n",
    "### When And Where To Apply Deep Learning?\n",
    "Thereâ€™s no denying that deep learning is a hot topic right now. But what does it really mean, and how should it be applied in practise?  \n",
    "- ``When not to use deep learning``  \n",
    "For one thing, deep learning really ``needs Big Data`` to make accurate decisions. So if you havenâ€™t got an extremely large dataset to learn from, a regular machine learning algorithm is likely to deliver more accurate results.\n",
    "Itâ€™s also ``more expensive`` to implement because it takes ``a lot of computing power`` to run a deep learning network. While services and tools like IBMâ€™s Watson are helping to lower the barrier to entry for deep learning, remember that deep learning is still at the very cutting edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``Where best to apply deep learning``  \n",
    "Deep learning is ideal for predicting outcomes whenever you have a lot of data to learn from â€“ â€˜a lotâ€™ being a huge dataset with hundreds of thousands or better ``millions of data points``. Where you have a huge volume of data like this, the system has what it needs to train itself.\n",
    "Itâ€™s also best when applied to ``complex problems`` and things that would be vastly expensive to solve with human decision making. ``Image processing`` is a great example of this. So, rather than YouTube paying an army of human workers to trawl through millions of videos and tag the ones with cats for our viewing pleasure, it makes much more sense to apply deep learning. Itâ€™s the same with ``translation`` and ``speech recognition``.\n",
    "And last but not least, deep learning is only appropriate if you have the high-end computing power to make it work, or are partnering with an analytics provider who has the infrastructure and skills that might be lacking in-house."
