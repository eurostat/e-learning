    "TensorFlow provides various number of machine learning algorithms inside it’s estimators module. Besides easy-to-use deep learning APIs such as Deep Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, etc, there are also a collection of popular machine learning algorithms. Currently, the following algorithms are included:\n",
